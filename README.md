# Self-Directed Learning in the Singaporean Public Service

## Introduction

Self-Directed Learning (SDL) is "a characteristic adaptation to steer and take responsibility in diagnosing learning needs and setting goals, choosing and implementing appropriate learning strategies and evaluating and adjusting the learning process" (Raemdonck, Thijssen, & de Greef, 2017).

The present research was motivated by ground sentiments among Public Service Officers, and sought to address the following research questions:

1. What is the level of self-directed learning among Public Service Officers in Singapore?
2. What is the relationship between self-directed learning and dimensions of learning organisation among Public Service Officers in Singapore?
